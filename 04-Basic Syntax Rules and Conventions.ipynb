    "\n",
    "   - In Python, indentation is crucial for defining code blocks and determining the structure of the program.\n",
    "   - Indentation is used to group statements together and indicate the scope of control flow structures (e.g., loops and conditional statements).\n",
    "   - The standard convention in Python is to use **four spaces** for indentation. It is recommended to avoid using tabs or a different number of spaces to maintain consistency and readability."

    "In this code, the indentation is crucial to define the structure and scope of the if statement. The indented code blocks represent the statements that are executed based on the condition. Here's a breakdown of how the indentation works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The line print(\"x is positive.\") is indented with four spaces, indicating that it belongs to the outer if statement.\n",
    "Inside the outer if statement, there is another if-else statement.\n",
    "The lines print(\"x is even.\") and print(\"x is odd.\") are further indented with eight spaces, showing that they are nested inside the inner if-else statement.\n",
    "Finally, the line print(\"End of program.\") is not indented, indicating that it is outside the if statement.\n",
    "The indentation is what allows Python to understand the hierarchical structure of the code and properly execute the corresponding blocks based on the conditions. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or logical errors in the program."
